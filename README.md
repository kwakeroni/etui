# Exiftool Template UI

This application provides a GUI for [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/),
a utility to add and modify metadata in image files.

In contrast to [ExifToolGUI](https://exiftool.org/gui/),
which is batch-oriented (applying the same metadata),
this application is template-oriented
(applying a uniform structure of metadata).

This application was created as a private tool, based on my own needs.
So don't expect new features to be added frequently.

This project is not associated with ExifTool or its creator.
