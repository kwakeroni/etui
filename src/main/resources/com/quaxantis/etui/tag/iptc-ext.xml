            The IPTC Photo Metadata Standard is the most widely used standard to describe photos, because of its
            universal acceptance
            among news agencies, photographers, photo agencies, libraries, museums, and other related industries.
            It structures and defines metadata properties that allow users to add precise and reliable data about
            images.

            Today, the IPTC Photo Metadata Standard consists of two schemas – IPTC Core and IPTC Extension –
            which were built on the legacy of the original IPTC-IIM,
            and developed by the IPTC for professional use with a focus on news and stock photos.
            IPTC worked alongside Adobe on the technical implementation of the metadata that employs Adobe’s XMP
            technology
            (now an ISO Standard)as an enriched alternative to the IIM format.

            IPTC Core and IPTC Extension define metadata properties with comprehensive sets of fields
            that allow users to add precise and reliable data about people, locations, and products shown in an image.
            It also supports dates, names and identifiers regarding the creation of the photo,
            and a flexible way to express rights information.

            This list provides a subset of the IPTC Extension metadata specification.
